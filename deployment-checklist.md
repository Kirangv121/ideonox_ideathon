# Deployment Checklist

## Before Deployment
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

2. Check for TypeScript errors:
   \`\`\`bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   \`\`\`

3. Run ESLint to check for code issues:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run lint
   \`\`\`

4. Test the build locally:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   \`\`\`

## Deployment Steps

### For Vercel Deployment:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy with default settings

### For Manual Deployment:
1. Build the application:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   \`\`\`

2. Start the production server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run start
   \`\`\`

## Common Deployment Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Missing dependencies
Solution: Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json and run `npm install`

### Issue: Build fails due to TypeScript errors
Solution: Fix TypeScript errors or add appropriate type definitions

### Issue: CSS/styling issues in production
Solution: Check for proper CSS imports and ensure PostCSS and Tailwind are configured correctly

### Issue: API calls failing
Solution: Check environment variables and CORS configuration

### Issue: Images not loading
Solution: Ensure proper configuration in next.config.js for image domains

### Issue: Client-side rendering issues
Solution: Check for any code that relies on browser-specific APIs and ensure proper use of useEffect

### Issue: Performance issues
Solution: Implement code splitting, optimize images, and minimize JavaScript bundles
